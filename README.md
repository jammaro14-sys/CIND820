**CIND820 Big Data Analytics Project**

by: Jamara Romero-Gennings

I will be reviewing the _Wages by Education Level_ dataset from the Ontario Government, sourced from Statistics Canada.
This study will focus on the province of Ontario Canada, with wage data from 2006 to 2024.

**Project Research Questions**
1. Confirm the existence of the gender wage gap in Ontario.
2. Examine wage trends across male and female groups to determine whether the gap is narrowing.
3. Examine wage trends across the different subgroups between genders to determine influence of immigration status on wage gap.
4. Verify the correlation between education levels and wages between genders.
